                    <span class="mainBody">You are currently standing in Glasgow Central, the busiest train station in Scotland. You are preparing to catch your usual 08:27 service to Ayr for work. As a new promoted insurance consultant & investigator, you were moved to the Ayr branch of Colonel Insurance to help get their successful claim rates down as the branch was hemorrhaging money.<hr>
                        You make your way over to the coffee stand and after noticing nobody was behind the counter, took the plunge and decided to use the self-service coffee dispensers on the main concourse. You'd heard awful things about that coffee. The ironically cheap taste, the scolding heat and water-like milk were all brushed aside in utter desperation for some caffeine.<hr>
                        You make your way onto platform 11. You expect the train not to be in yet as it is always at least 20 minutes late but no, it's there, sitting in the platform. Ready for boarding.
                        You hesitiate. You check your watch to make sure this is right train. Your watch reads 08:24, it must be the right train. Peering in the windows, you see that nobody is on-board, the doors are open and the lights are on but nobody is here. <hr>
